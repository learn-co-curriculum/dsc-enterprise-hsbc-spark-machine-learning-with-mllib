## Lab: Machine Learning with the Titanic Dataset

**Step 1** Read in two datasources from the `../data` folder, one is meant for training the other for testing, you do not need to split or clean the data. 

  * titanic_train_clean.csv
  * titanic_test_clean.csv 

**Step 2:** Do the necessary preparation

**Step 3:** Prepare the dataset to be used with a `VectorAssembler`

**Step 4:** Create a `DecisionTreeClassifier`

**Step 5:** `fit` the training data, and use `trasnform` with the testing data

**Step 6:** Determine how well it did with a `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`

**Step 7:** If time remaining, try using a `RandomForestClassifier`

**Step 8:** `fit` the training data, and use `transform` with the testing data

**Step 9:** Determine how well it did with a `BinaryClassificationEvaluator`
